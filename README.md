# 🕵️‍♂️ Phrase Hunter Game

A fun **word-guessing game** built with JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal is to guess the hidden phrase by selecting letters on the onscreen keyboard or using your physical keyboard.

## 🌟 Features
- **Random phrase selection** from a predefined set of phrases.
- **Onscreen keyboard & physical keyboard support** for letter selection.
- **5 lives system** – every wrong guess removes a life.
- **Win/loss detection** – win by revealing all letters or lose after 5 incorrect guesses.
- **Styled user interface** with nice visuals.

## 🎨 Customizations & Design Changes
I made several visual and interactive improvements to personalize the game:

### 🖋 **Typography & Colors**
- Changed font family for a more playful feel.
- Updated background and text colors for more eye-catching visuals.

### 🎹 **Keyboard Styling**
- Correct Guesses: Keys that are correct turn green to give visual feedback.
- Incorrect Guesses: Wrong guesses turn the keys red to indicate a mistake.
- Hover effect: Keys enlarge slightly and change color on hover.

### 💖 **Scoreboard Update**
- Replaced the default hearts images with cute cat images 🐱.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for the game layout.
- **CSS3**: styling for the game’s visual appeal.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Used to handle the game logic and interactions.
