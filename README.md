# 🕵️‍♂️ Phrase Hunter Game

A fun **word-guessing game** built with JavaScript using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal is to guess the hidden phrase by selecting letters on the onscreen keyboard or using your physical keyboard.

## 🌟 Features
- **Random phrase selection** from a predefined set.
- **Onscreen keyboard & physical keyboard support** for letter selection.
- **5 lives system** – every wrong guess removes a life.
- **Win/loss detection** – win by revealing all letters or lose after 5 incorrect guesses.
- **Styled user interface** with nice visuals.

## 🎨 Customizations & Design Changes
I made several visual and interactive improvements to personalize the game:

### 🖋 **Typography & Colors**
- **Changed font family** for a more playful feel.
- **Updated background and text colors** for more dynamic visuals.

### 🎹 **Keyboard Styling**
- **Correct letters turn green**.
- **Incorrect letters turn red**.
- **Hover effect:** Keys now **enlarge slightly** and **change color on hover**.

### 💖 **Scoreboard Update**
- **Replaced default hearts with cat images** 🐱.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for the game.
- **CSS3**: Styling for visual feedback.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic and interactive features.

🎮 Enjoy the game!
